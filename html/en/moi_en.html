          I've also been playing volleyball for 3 years now. I'm not as good as some of the top players, but this sport allows me to take a breather from the daily grind. I enjoy hitting the ball and letting off steam. <br> I started out at a small club near my home, and now I'm at the IUT with other players who are much stronger than me. I enjoy playing against them, I'm not afraid of a challenge and I'm always keen to improve.

          Like any young adult, I like to relax and video games help me to do that. I thrive on playing strategy games or simply challenging myself.

        <p>Principal objective: Teacher Researcher <br> <br> <br> To become a teacher-researcher, I'd first like to finish my BUT with the DevCloud course and do my third year abroad. Then I'd like to go to engineering school and finish with a PhD. <br> This is the route I would like to take at the moment. It is quite possible that it will evolve with time and my experiences.</p>
